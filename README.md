# Xray-Detection
In this project Detection of Covid-19 is done with the help of machine learning algorithm - Convolutional Neural Network using Chest X-ray images.

Data source - Covid X-Ray Image Dataset - https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset for positive cases.
               Kaggle X-Ray Chest Images - https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia for negative cases.
